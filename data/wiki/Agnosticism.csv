1,Agnosticism,h1,0,0,0
19,"Agnosticism is the view that the existence of God, of the divine or the supernatural is unknown or unknowable.",p,0,0,1
32,"Another definition provided is the view that ""human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist.""",p,0,0,1
83,"The English biologist Thomas Henry Huxley coined the word agnostic in 1869, and said ""It simply means that a man shall not say he knows or believes that which he has no scientific grounds for professing to know or believe."" Earlier thinkers, however, had written works that promoted agnostic points of view, such as Sanjaya Belatthaputta, a 5th-century BCE Indian philosopher who expressed agnosticism about any afterlife; and Protagoras, a 5th-century BCE Greek philosopher who expressed agnosticism about the existence of ""the gods"".",p,0,0,2
2,Defining agnosticism,h2,1,0,3
11,"Agnosticism is of the essence of science, whether ancient or modern.",p,1,0,4
26,It simply means that a man shall not say he knows or believes that which he has no scientific grounds for professing to know or believe.,p,1,0,4
19,"Consequently, agnosticism puts aside not only the greater part of popular theology, but also the greater part of anti-theology.",p,1,0,4
30,"On the whole, the ""bosh"" of heterodoxy is more offensive to me than that of orthodoxy, because heterodoxy professes to be guided by reason and science, and orthodoxy does not.",p,1,0,4
41,"That which Agnostics deny and repudiate, as immoral, is the contrary doctrine, that there are propositions which men ought to believe, without logically satisfactory evidence; and that reprobation ought to attach to the profession of disbelief in such inadequately supported propositions.",p,1,0,5
24,"Agnosticism, in fact, is not a creed, but a method, the essence of which lies in the rigorous application of a single principle ...",p,1,0,6
27,"Positively the principle may be expressed: In matters of the intellect, follow your reason as far as it will take you, without regard to any other consideration.",p,1,0,6
20,And negatively: In matters of the intellect do not pretend that conclusions are certain which are not demonstrated or demonstrable.,p,1,0,6
14,"Being a scientist, above all else, Huxley presented agnosticism as a form of demarcation.",p,1,0,7
14,"A hypothesis with no supporting, objective, testable evidence is not an objective, scientific claim.",p,1,0,7
15,"As such, there would be no way to test said hypotheses, leaving the results inconclusive.",p,1,0,7
20,"His agnosticism was not compatible with forming a belief as to the truth, or falsehood, of the claim at hand.",p,1,0,7
9,Karl Popper would also describe himself as an agnostic.,p,1,0,7
5,According to philosopher William L.,p,1,0,7
35,"Rowe, in this strict sense, agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist.",p,1,0,7
2,George H.,p,1,0,8
45,"Smith, while admitting that the narrow definition of atheist was the common usage definition of that word, and admitting that the broad definition of agnostic was the common usage definition of that word, promoted broadening the definition of atheist and narrowing the definition of agnostic.",p,1,0,8
75,"Smith rejects agnosticism as a third alternative to theism and atheism and promotes terms such as agnostic atheism (the view of those who do not hold a belief in the existence of any deity, but claim that the existence of a deity is unknown or inherently unknowable) and agnostic theism (the view of those who believe in the existence of a deity(s), but claim that the existence of a deity is unknown or inherently unknowable).",p,1,0,8
1,Etymology,h3,1,1,9
42,"Agnostic (from Ancient Greek ἀ- (a-) 'without', and γνῶσις (gnōsis) 'knowledge') was used by Thomas Henry Huxley in a speech at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1869 to describe his philosophy, which rejects all claims of spiritual or mystical knowledge.",p,1,1,10
14,"Early Christian church leaders used the Greek word gnosis (knowledge) to describe ""spiritual knowledge"".",p,1,1,11
28,"Agnosticism is not to be confused with religious views opposing the ancient religious movement of Gnosticism in particular; Huxley used the term in a broader, more abstract sense.",p,1,1,11
16,"Huxley identified agnosticism not as a creed but rather as a method of skeptical, evidence-based inquiry.",p,1,1,11
61,"The term Agnostic is also cognate with the Sanskrit word Ajñasi which translates literally to ""not knowable"", and relates to the ancient Indian philosophical school of Ajñana, which proposes that it is impossible to obtain knowledge of metaphysical nature or ascertain the truth value of philosophical propositions; and even if knowledge was possible, it is useless and disadvantageous for final salvation.",p,1,1,12
18,"In recent years, scientific literature dealing with neuroscience and psychology has used the word to mean ""not knowable"".",p,1,1,13
22,"In technical and marketing literature, ""agnostic"" can also mean independence from some parameters—for example, ""platform agnostic"" (referring to cross-platform software) or ""hardware-agnostic"".",p,1,1,13
2,Qualifying agnosticism,h3,1,2,14
20,Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume contended that meaningful statements about the universe are always qualified by some degree of doubt.,p,1,2,15
27,He asserted that the fallibility of human beings means that they cannot obtain absolute certainty except in trivial cases where a statement is true by definition (e.g.,p,1,2,15
13,"tautologies such as ""all bachelors are unmarried"" or ""all triangles have three corners"").",p,1,2,15

2,Hindu philosophy,h3,2,4,18
16,Throughout the history of Hinduism there has been a strong tradition of philosophic speculation and skepticism.,p,2,4,19
20,The Rig Veda takes an agnostic view on the fundamental question of how the universe and the gods were created.,p,2,4,20
13,Nasadiya Sukta (Creation Hymn) in the tenth chapter of the Rig Veda says:,p,2,4,20
17,"But, after all, who knows, and who can say Whence it all came, and how creation happened?",p,2,4,21
15,"The gods themselves are later than creation, so who knows truly whence it has arisen?",p,2,4,21
34,"Whence all creation had its origin, He, whether he fashioned it or whether he did not, He, who surveys it all from highest heaven, He knows – or maybe even he does not know.",p,2,4,21
4,"Hume, Kant, and Kierkegaard",h3,2,5,22
16,"Aristotle, Anselm, Aquinas, Descartes, and Gödel presented arguments attempting to rationally prove the existence of God.",p,2,5,23
41,"The skeptical empiricism of David Hume, the antinomies of Immanuel Kant, and the existential philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard convinced many later philosophers to abandon these attempts, regarding it impossible to construct any unassailable proof for the existence or non-existence of God.",p,2,5,23
8,"In his 1844 book, Philosophical Fragments, Kierkegaard writes:",p,2,5,24
7,Let us call this unknown something: God.,p,2,5,25
11,It is nothing more than a name we assign to it.,p,2,5,25
16,"The idea of demonstrating that this unknown something (God) exists, could scarcely suggest itself to Reason.",p,2,5,25
27,For if God does not exist it would of course be impossible to prove it; and if he does exist it would be folly to attempt it.,p,2,5,25
53,"For at the very outset, in beginning my proof, I would have presupposed it, not as doubtful but as certain (a presupposition is never doubtful, for the very reason that it is a presupposition), since otherwise I would not begin, readily understanding that the whole would be impossible if he did not exist.",p,2,5,25
28,"But if when I speak of proving God's existence I mean that I propose to prove that the Unknown, which exists, is God, then I express myself unfortunately.",p,2,5,25
22,"For in that case I do not prove anything, least of all an existence, but merely develop the content of a conception.",p,2,5,25
11,"Hume was Huxley's favourite philosopher, calling him ""the Prince of Agnostics"".",p,2,5,26
43,"Diderot wrote to his mistress, telling of a visit by Hume to the Baron D'Holbach, and describing how a word for the position that Huxley would later describe as agnosticism didn't seem to exist, or at least wasn't common knowledge, at the time.",p,2,5,26
5,The first time that M.,p,2,5,27
14,"Hume found himself at the table of the Baron, he was seated beside him.",p,2,5,27
32,"I don't know for what purpose the English philosopher took it into his head to remark to the Baron that he did not believe in atheists, that he had never seen any.",p,2,5,27
14,"The Baron said to him: ""Count how many we are here."" We are eighteen.",p,2,5,27
28,"The Baron added: ""It isn't too bad a showing to be able to point out to you fifteen at once: the three others haven't made up their minds.""",p,2,5,27
2,United Kingdom,h3,2,6,28
14,"Raised in a religious environment, Charles Darwin (1809–1882) studied to be an Anglican clergyman.",p,2,6,29
19,"While eventually doubting parts of his faith, Darwin continued to help in church affairs, even while avoiding church attendance.",p,2,6,29
20,"Darwin stated that it would be ""absurd to doubt that a man might be an ardent theist and an evolutionist"".",p,2,6,29
27,"Although reticent about his religious views, in 1879 he wrote that ""I have never been an atheist in the sense of denying the existence of a God.",p,2,6,29
6,– I think that generally ...,p,2,6,29
13,"an agnostic would be the most correct description of my state of mind.""",p,2,6,29
39,"Agnostic views are as old as philosophical skepticism, but the terms agnostic and agnosticism were created by Huxley (1825–1895) to sum up his thoughts on contemporary developments of metaphysics about the ""unconditioned"" (William Hamilton) and the ""unknowable"" (Herbert Spencer).",p,2,6,30
20,"Though Huxley began to use the term ""agnostic"" in 1869, his opinions had taken shape some time before that date.",p,2,6,30
15,"In a letter of September 23, 1860, to Charles Kingsley, Huxley discussed his views extensively:",p,2,6,30
9,I neither affirm nor deny the immortality of man.,p,2,6,31
19,"I see no reason for believing it, but, on the other hand, I have no means of disproving it.",p,2,6,31
9,I have no a priori objections to the doctrine.,p,2,6,31
18,No man who has to deal daily and hourly with nature can trouble himself about a priori difficulties.,p,2,6,31
18,"Give me such evidence as would justify me in believing in anything else, and I will believe that.",p,2,6,31
4,Why should I not?,p,2,6,31
17,It is not half so wonderful as the conservation of force or the indestructibility of matter ...,p,2,6,31
12,It is no use to talk to me of analogies and probabilities.,p,2,6,32
31,"I know what I mean when I say I believe in the law of the inverse squares, and I will not rest my life and my hopes upon weaker convictions ...",p,2,6,32
12,That my personality is the surest thing I know may be true.,p,2,6,33
14,But the attempt to conceive what it is leads me into mere verbal subtleties.,p,2,6,33
46,"I have champed up all that chaff about the ego and the non-ego, noumena and phenomena, and all the rest of it, too often not to know that in attempting even to think of these questions, the human intellect flounders at once out of its depth.",p,2,6,33
9,"And again, to the same correspondent, May 6, 1863:",p,2,6,34
32,"I have never had the least sympathy with the a priori reasons against orthodoxy, and I have by nature and disposition the greatest possible antipathy to all the atheistic and infidel school.",p,2,6,35
30,"Nevertheless I know that I am, in spite of myself, exactly what the Christian would call, and, so far as I can see, is justified in calling, atheist and infidel.",p,2,6,35
37,I cannot see one shadow or tittle of evidence that the great unknown underlying the phenomenon of the universe stands to us in the relation of a Father loves us and cares for us as Christianity asserts.,p,2,6,35
56,"So with regard to the other great Christian dogmas, immortality of soul and future state of rewards and punishments, what possible objection can I—who am compelled perforce to believe in the immortality of what we call Matter and Force, and in a very unmistakable present state of rewards and punishments for our deeds—have to these doctrines?",p,2,6,35
14,"Give me a scintilla of evidence, and I am ready to jump at them.",p,2,6,35
16,"Of the origin of the name agnostic to describe this attitude, Huxley gave the following account:",p,2,6,36
67,"When I reached intellectual maturity and began to ask myself whether I was an atheist, a theist, or a pantheist; a materialist or an idealist; Christian or a freethinker; I found that the more I learned and reflected, the less ready was the answer; until, at last, I came to the conclusion that I had neither art nor part with any of these denominations, except the last.",p,2,6,37
22,The one thing in which most of these good people were agreed was the one thing in which I differed from them.,p,2,6,37
38,"They were quite sure they had attained a certain ""gnosis""–had, more or less successfully, solved the problem of existence; while I was quite sure I had not, and had a pretty strong conviction that the problem was insoluble.",p,2,6,37
21,"And, with Hume and Kant on my side, I could not think myself presumptuous in holding fast by that opinion ...",p,2,6,37
16,"So I took thought, and invented what I conceived to be the appropriate title of ""agnostic"".",p,2,6,37
29,"It came into my head as suggestively antithetic to the ""gnostic"" of Church history, who professed to know so much about the very things of which I was ignorant.",p,2,6,37

7,To my great satisfaction the term took.,p,2,6,37
4,"In 1889, Huxley wrote:",p,2,6,38
50,"Therefore, although it be, as I believe, demonstrable that we have no real knowledge of the authorship, or of the date of composition of the Gospels, as they have come down to us, and that nothing better than more or less probable guesses can be arrived at on that subject.",p,2,6,39
10,William Stewart Ross (1844–1906) wrote under the name of Saladin.,p,2,6,40
13,He was associated with Victorian Freethinkers and the organization the British Secular Union.,p,2,6,40
19,He edited the Secular Review from 1882; it was renamed Agnostic Journal and Eclectic Review and closed in 1907.,p,2,6,40

21,"In 1939, Russell gave a lecture on The existence and nature of God, in which he characterized himself as an atheist.",p,2,6,43
2,He said:,p,2,6,43
16,The existence and nature of God is a subject of which I can discuss only half.,p,2,6,44
38,"If one arrives at a negative conclusion concerning the first part of the question, the second part of the question does not arise; and my position, as you may have gathered, is a negative one on this matter.",p,2,6,44

46,"As a philosopher, if I were speaking to a purely philosophic audience I should say that I ought to describe myself as an Agnostic, because I do not think that there is a conclusive argument by which one can prove that there is not a God.",p,2,6,48
60,"On the other hand, if I am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street I think I ought to say that I am an Atheist, because when I say that I cannot prove that there is not a God, I ought to add equally that I cannot prove that there are not the Homeric gods.",p,2,6,48
8,"In his 1953 essay, What Is An Agnostic?",p,2,6,49
2,Russell states:,p,2,6,49
26,An agnostic thinks it impossible to know the truth in matters such as God and the future life with which Christianity and other religions are concerned.,p,2,6,50

6,"Later in the essay, Russell adds:",p,2,6,53
56,"I think that if I heard a voice from the sky predicting all that was going to happen to me during the next twenty-four hours, including events that would have seemed highly improbable, and if all these events then produced to happen, I might perhaps be convinced at least of the existence of some superhuman intelligence.",p,2,6,54

8,I do not know—but I do not believe.,p,2,7,62

57,"Canon Bernard Iddings Bell (1886–1958), a popular cultural commentator, Episcopal priest, and author, lauded the necessity of agnosticism in Beyond Agnosticism: A Book for Tired Mechanists, calling it the foundation of ""all intelligent Christianity."" Agnosticism was a temporary mindset in which one rigorously questioned the truths of the age, including the way in which one believed God.",p,2,7,69
37,"His view of Robert Ingersoll and Thomas Paine was that they were not denouncing true Christianity but rather ""a gross perversion of it."" Part of the misunderstanding stemmed from ignorance of the concepts of God and religion.",p,2,7,69
27,"Historically, a god was any real, perceivable force that ruled the lives of humans and inspired admiration, love, fear, and homage; religion was the practice of it.",p,2,7,69
44,"Ancient peoples worshiped gods with real counterparts, such as Mammon (money and material things), Nabu (rationality), or Ba'al (violent weather); Bell argued that modern peoples were still paying homage—with their lives and their children's lives—to these old gods of wealth, physical appetites, and self-deification.",p,2,7,69
20,"Thus, if one attempted to be agnostic passively, he or she would incidentally join the worship of the world's gods.",p,2,7,69
25,"In Unfashionable Convictions (1931), he criticized the Enlightenment's complete faith in human sensory perception, augmented by scientific instruments, as a means of accurately grasping Reality.",p,2,7,70
22,"Firstly, it was fairly new, an innovation of the Western World, which Aristotle invented and Thomas Aquinas revived among the scientific community.",p,2,7,70
31,"Secondly, the divorce of ""pure"" science from human experience, as manifested in American Industrialization, had completely altered the environment, often disfiguring it, so as to suggest its insufficiency to human needs.",p,2,7,70
47,"Thirdly, because scientists were constantly producing more data—to the point where no single human could grasp it all at once—it followed that human intelligence was incapable of attaining a complete understanding of universe; therefore, to admit the mysteries of the unobserved universe was to be actually scientific.",p,2,7,70
17,Bell believed that there were two other ways that humans could perceive and interact with the world.,p,2,7,71
23,"Artistic experience was how one expressed meaning through speaking, writing, painting, gesturing—any sort of communication which shared insight into a human's inner reality.",p,2,7,71
18,"Mystical experience was how one could ""read"" people and harmonize with them, being what we commonly call love.",p,2,7,71

1,Criticism,h2,4,7,78
8,Agnosticism is criticized from a variety of standpoints.,p,4,7,79
30,Some atheists criticize the use of the term agnosticism as functionally indistinguishable from atheism; this results in frequent criticisms of those who adopt the term as avoiding the atheist label.,p,4,7,79
1,Theistic,h3,4,8,80
34,"Theistic critics claim that agnosticism is impossible in practice, since a person can live only either as if God did not exist (etsi deus non-daretur), or as if God did exist (etsi deus daretur).",p,4,8,81
21,"According to Pope Benedict XVI, strong agnosticism in particular contradicts itself in affirming the power of reason to know scientific truth.",p,4,8,82
21,He blames the exclusion of reasoning from religion and ethics for dangerous pathologies such as crimes against humanity and ecological disasters.,p,4,8,82

7,"The knowledge of God has always existed"".",p,4,8,82
49,"He asserted that agnosticism is a choice of comfort, pride, dominion, and utility over truth, and is opposed by the following attitudes: the keenest self-criticism, humble listening to the whole of existence, the persistent patience and self-correction of the scientific method, a readiness to be purified by the truth.",p,4,8,82
41,"The Catholic Church sees merit in examining what it calls ""partial agnosticism"", specifically those systems that ""do not aim at constructing a complete philosophy of the unknowable, but at excluding special kinds of truth, notably religious, from the domain of knowledge"".",p,4,8,83

30,"The Council of the Vatican declares, ""God, the beginning and end of all, can, by the natural light of human reason, be known with certainty from the works of creation"".",p,4,8,83
53,"Blaise Pascal argued that even if there were truly no evidence for God, agnostics should consider what is now known as Pascal's Wager: the infinite expected value of acknowledging God is always greater than the finite expected value of not acknowledging his existence, and thus it is a safer ""bet"" to choose God.",p,4,8,84

34,"According to Richard Dawkins, a distinction between agnosticism and atheism is unwieldy and depends on how close to zero a person is willing to rate the probability of existence for any given god-like entity.",p,4,9,86
41,"About himself, Dawkins continues, ""I am agnostic only to the extent that I am agnostic about fairies at the bottom of the garden."" Dawkins also identifies two categories of agnostics; ""Temporary Agnostics in Practice"" (TAPs), and ""Permanent Agnostics in Principle"" (PAPs).",p,4,9,86

31,"A related concept is ignosticism, the view that a coherent definition of a deity must be put forward before the question of the existence of a deity can be meaningfully discussed.",p,5,9,88

37,"Ayer, Theodore Drange, and other philosophers see both atheism and agnosticism as incompatible with ignosticism on the grounds that atheism and agnosticism accept ""a deity exists"" as a meaningful proposition that can be argued for or against.",p,5,9,88
