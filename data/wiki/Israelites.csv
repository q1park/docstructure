1,Etymology,h2,1,0,8
46,"The term Israelite is the English name for the descendants of the biblical patriarch Jacob in ancient times, which is derived from the Greek Ἰσραηλῖται, which was used to translate the Biblical Hebrew term b'nei yisrael, יִשְׂרָאֵל as either ""sons of Israel"" or ""children of Israel"".",p,1,0,9

19,"The Hebrew Bible etymologizes the name as from yisra ""to prevail over"" or ""to struggle/wrestle with"", and El (God).",p,1,0,10
38,"However, modern scholarship interprets El as the subject, ""El rules/struggles"", from sarar (שָׂרַר) 'to rule' (cognate with sar (שַׂר) 'ruler', Akkadian šarru 'ruler, king' ), which is likely cognate with the similar root sara (שׂרה) ""fought, strove, contended"".",p,1,0,10
