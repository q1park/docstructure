14,Belief in an afterlife is in contrast to the belief in oblivion after death.,p,0,0,1
44,"In some views, this continued existence takes place in a spiritual realm, and in other popular views, the individual may be reborn into this world and begin the life cycle over again, likely with no memory of what they have done in the past.",p,0,0,2

39,"The historical relations between these sects and the beliefs about reincarnation that were characteristic of Neoplatonism, Orphism, Hermeticism, Manicheanism, and Gnosticism of the Roman era as well as the Indian religions have been the subject of recent scholarly research.",p,1,1,9
9,Unity Church and its founder Charles Fillmore teach reincarnation.,p,1,1,9
41,"Rosicrucians speak of a life review period occurring immediately after death and before entering the afterlife's planes of existence (before the silver cord is broken), followed by a judgment, more akin to a final review or end report over one's life.",p,1,1,10
3,Heaven and Hell,h3,1,2,11
40,"Heaven, the heavens, seven heavens, pure lands, Tian, Jannah, Valhalla, or the Summerland, is a common religious, cosmological, or transcendent place where beings such as gods, angels, jinn, saints, or venerated ancestors are said to originate, be enthroned, or live.",p,1,2,12

25,"Typically, these traditions locate hell in another dimension or under the earth's surface and often include entrances to hell from the land of the living.",p,1,2,15
7,Other afterlife destinations include purgatory and limbo.,p,1,2,15
40,"Traditions that do not conceive of the afterlife as a place of punishment or reward merely describe hell as an abode of the dead, the grave, a neutral place (for example, sheol or Hades) located under the surface of earth.",p,1,2,16

8,"They also used the ""opening of the mouth"".",p,2,3,21
22,Ancient Egyptian civilization was based on religion; their belief in the rebirth after death became the driving force behind their funeral practices.,p,2,3,22
42,"Death was simply a temporary interruption, rather than complete cessation, of life, and that eternal life could be ensured by means like piety to the gods, preservation of the physical form through mummification, and the provision of statuary and other funerary equipment.",p,2,3,22

2,Abrahamic religions,h2,3,5,32
2,Baháʼí Faith,h3,3,6,33

1,Christianity,h3,3,7,36
37,"Mainstream Christianity professes belief in the Nicene Creed, and English versions of the Nicene Creed in current use include the phrase: ""We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come.""",p,3,7,37
50,"When questioned by the Sadducees about the resurrection of the dead (in a context relating to who one's spouse would be if one had been married several times in life), Jesus said that marriage will be irrelevant after the resurrection as the resurrected will be like the angels in heaven.",p,3,7,38
52,"Jesus also maintained that the time would come when the dead would hear the voice of the Son of God, and all who were in the tombs would come out, who have done good deeds to the resurrection of life, but those who have done wicked deeds to the resurrection of condemnation.",p,3,7,39
53,"The Book of Enoch describes Sheol as divided into four compartments for four types of the dead: the faithful saints who await resurrection in Paradise, the merely virtuous who await their reward, the wicked who await punishment, and the wicked who have already been punished and will not be resurrected on Judgment Day.",p,3,7,40
17,The Book of Enoch is considered apocryphal by most denominations of Christianity and all denominations of Judaism.,p,3,7,40
31,"The book of 2 Maccabees gives a clear account of the dead awaiting a future resurrection and judgment, plus prayers and offerings for the dead to remove the burden of sin.",p,3,7,41

12,"There is mention of ghostly bodies of past prophets, and the transfiguration.",p,3,7,42
27,"The non-canonical Acts of Paul and Thecla speak of the efficacy of prayer for the dead, so that they might be ""translated to a state of happiness"".",p,3,7,43
49,"Hippolytus of Rome pictures the underworld (Hades) as a place where the righteous dead, awaiting in the bosom of Abraham their resurrection, rejoice at their future prospect, while the unrighteous are tormented at the sight of the ""lake of unquenchable fire"" into which they are destined to be cast.",p,3,7,44
14,Gregory of Nyssa discusses the long-before believed possibility of purification of souls after death.,p,3,7,45
31,"Pope Gregory I repeats the concept, articulated over a century earlier by Gregory of Nyssa that the saved suffer purification after death, in connection with which he wrote of ""purgatorial flames"".",p,3,7,46
26,"The noun ""purgatorium"" (Latin: place of cleansing ) is used for the first time to describe a state of painful purification of the saved after life.",p,3,7,47
36,"The same word in adjectival form (purgatorius -a -um, cleansing), which appears also in non-religious writing, was already used by Christians such as Augustine of Hippo and Pope Gregory I to refer to an after-death cleansing.",p,3,7,47
13,"During the Age of Enlightenment, theologians and philosophers presented various philosophies and beliefs.",p,3,7,48
36,"A notable example is Emanuel Swedenborg who wrote some 18 theological works which describe in detail the nature of the afterlife according to his claimed spiritual experiences, the most famous of which is Heaven and Hell.",p,3,7,48
107,"His report of life there covers a wide range of topics, such as marriage in heaven (where all angels are married), children in heaven (where they are raised by angel parents), time and space in heaven (there are none), the after-death awakening process in the World of Spirits (a place halfway between Heaven and Hell and where people first wake up after death), the allowance of a free will choice between Heaven or Hell (as opposed to being sent to either one by God), the eternity of Hell (one could leave but would never want to), and that all angels or devils were once people on earth.",p,3,7,48
24,"The ""Spiritual Combat"", a written work by Lorenzo Scupoli, states that four assaults are attempted by the ""evil one"" at the hour of death.",p,3,7,49
24,"The Catholic conception of the afterlife teaches that after the body dies, the soul is judged, the righteous and free of sin enter Heaven.",p,3,7,49
11,"However, those who die in unrepented mortal sin go to hell.",p,3,7,49
26,"In the 1990s, the Catechism of the Catholic Church defined hell not as punishment imposed on the sinner but rather as the sinner's self-exclusion from God.",p,3,7,49
35,"Unlike other Christian groups, the Catholic Church teaches that those who die in a state of grace, but still carry venial sin go to a place called Purgatory where they undergo purification to enter Heaven.",p,3,7,49
39,"Despite popular opinion, Limbo, which was elaborated upon by theologians beginning in the Middle Ages, was never recognized as a dogma of the Catholic Church, yet, at times, it has been a very popular theological theory within the Church.",p,3,7,50
38,"Limbo is a theory that unbaptized but innocent souls, such as those of infants, virtuous individuals who lived before Jesus Christ was born on earth, or those that die before baptism exist in neither Heaven or Hell proper.",p,3,7,50
34,"Therefore, these souls neither merit the beatific vision, nor are subjected to any punishment, because they are not guilty of any personal sin although they have not received baptism, so still bear original sin.",p,3,7,50
21,"So they are generally seen as existing in a state of natural, but not supernatural, happiness, until the end of time.",p,3,7,50
20,In other Christian denominations it has been described as an intermediate place or state of confinement in oblivion and neglect.,p,3,7,51
11,The notion of purgatory is associated particularly with the Catholic Church.,p,3,7,52
60,"In the Catholic Church, all those who die in God's grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation; but after death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven or the final purification of the elect, which is entirely different from the punishment of the damned.",p,3,7,52
24,"The tradition of the church, by reference to certain texts of scripture, speaks of a ""cleansing fire"" although it is not always called purgatory.",p,3,7,52
11,Anglicans of the Anglo-Catholic tradition generally also hold to the belief.,p,3,7,53
53,"John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, believed in an intermediate state between death and the resurrection of the dead and in the possibility of ""continuing to grow in holiness there"", but Methodism does not officially affirm this belief and denies the possibility of helping by prayer any who may be in that state.",p,3,7,53
22,"The Orthodox Church is intentionally reticent on the afterlife, as it acknowledges the mystery especially of things that have not yet occurred.",p,3,7,54
32,"Beyond the second coming of Jesus, bodily resurrection, and final judgment, all of which is affirmed in the Nicene Creed (325 CE), Orthodoxy does not teach much else in any definitive manner.",p,3,7,54
39,"Unlike Western forms of Christianity, however, Orthodoxy is traditionally non-dualist and does not teach that there are two separate literal locations of heaven and hell, but instead acknowledges that ""the 'location' of one's final destiny—heaven or hell—as being figurative.""",p,3,7,54
44,"Instead, Orthodoxy teaches that the final judgment is simply one's uniform encounter with divine love and mercy, but this encounter is experienced multifariously depending on the extent to which one has been transformed, partaken of divinity, and is therefore compatible or incompatible with God.",p,3,7,55
42,"""The monadic, immutable, and ceaseless object of eschatological encounter is therefore the love and mercy of God, his glory which infuses the heavenly temple, and it is the subjective human reaction which engenders multiplicity or any division of experience."" For instance, St.",p,3,7,55
18,"Isaac the Syrian observes that ""those who are punished in Gehenna, are scourged by the scourge of love.",p,3,7,55

12,The power of love works in two ways: it torments sinners ...,p,3,7,55
2,bitter regret.,p,3,7,55
48,"But love inebriates the souls of the sons of Heaven by its delectability."" In this sense, the divine action is always, immutably, and uniformly love and if one experiences this love negatively, the experience is then one of self-condemnation because of free will rather than condemnation by God.",p,3,7,55
41,"Orthodoxy therefore uses the description of Jesus' judgment in John 3:19–21 as their model: ""19 And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil.",p,3,7,56
23,"20 For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed.",p,3,7,56
34,"21 But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God."" As a characteristically Orthodox understanding, then, Fr.",p,3,7,56

17,"Moreover, Orthodoxy includes a prevalent tradition of apokatastasis, or the restoration of all things in the end.",p,3,7,57
20,"This has been taught most notably by Origen, but also many other Church fathers and Saints, including Gregory of Nyssa.",p,3,7,57
35,"The Second Council of Constantinople (553 CE) affirmed the orthodoxy of Gregory of Nyssa while simultaneously condemning Origen's brand of universalism because it taught the restoration back to our pre-existent state, which Orthodoxy doesn't teach.",p,3,7,57
20,"It is also a teaching of such eminent Orthodox theologians as Olivier Clément, Metropolitan Kallistos Ware, and Bishop Hilarion Alfeyev.",p,3,7,57
26,"Although apokatastasis is not a dogma of the church but instead a theologoumenon, it is no less a teaching of the Orthodox Church than its rejection.",p,3,7,57
2,As Met.,p,3,7,57
41,"Kallistos Ware explains, ""It is heretical to say that all must be saved, for this is to deny free will; but, it is legitimate to hope that all may be saved,"" as insisting on torment without end also denies free will.",p,3,7,57

17,Smith of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints presents an elaborate vision of the afterlife.,p,3,7,58
35,"It is revealed as the scene of an extensive missionary effort by righteous spirits in paradise to redeem those still in darkness—a spirit prison or ""hell"" where the spirits of the dead remain until judgment.",p,3,7,58
10,It is divided into two parts: Spirit Prison and Paradise.,p,3,7,58
15,Together these are also known as the Spirit World (also Abraham's Bosom; see Luke 16:19–25).,p,3,7,58
23,They believe that Christ visited spirit prison (1 Peter 3:18–20) and opened the gate for those who repent to cross over to Paradise.,p,3,7,58
27,This is similar to the Harrowing of Hell doctrine of some mainstream Christian faiths.[citation needed] Both Spirit Prison and Paradise are temporary according to Latter-day Saint beliefs.,p,3,7,58
23,"After the resurrection, spirits are assigned ""permanently"" to three degrees of heavenly glory, determined by how they lived – Celestial, Terrestrial, and Telestial.",p,3,7,58
44,"(1 Cor 15:44–42; Doctrine and Covenants, Section 76) Sons of Perdition, or those who have known and seen God and deny it, will be sent to the realm of Satan, which is called Outer Darkness, where they shall live in misery and agony forever.",p,3,7,58
26,"However, according to Mormon faith, since most persons lack the amount of knowledge to commit the Eternal sin, they are incapable of becoming sons of perdition.",p,3,7,58
18,The Celestial Kingdom is believed to be a place where the righteous can live eternally with their families.,p,3,7,59
15,"Progression does not end once one has entered the Celestial Kingdom, but it extends eternally.",p,3,7,59
58,"According to ""True to the Faith"" (a handbook on doctrines in the LDS faith), ""The celestial kingdom is the place prepared for those who have ""received the testimony of Jesus"" and been ""made perfect through Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, who wrought out this perfect atonement through the shedding of his own blood"" (D&C 76:51, 69).",p,3,7,59
19,"To inherit this gift, we must receive the ordinances of salvation, keep the commandments, and repent of our sins.""",p,3,7,59
28,"Jehovah's Witnesses occasionally use terms such as ""afterlife"" to refer to any hope for the dead, but they understand Ecclesiastes 9:5 to preclude belief in an immortal soul.",p,3,7,60
23,"Individuals judged by God to be wicked, such as in the Great Flood or at Armageddon, are given no hope of an afterlife.",p,3,7,60
22,"However, they believe that after Armageddon there will be a bodily resurrection of ""both righteous and unrighteous"" dead (but not the ""wicked"").",p,3,7,60
17,Survivors of Armageddon and those who are resurrected are then to gradually restore earth to a paradise.,p,3,7,60

13,The Seventh-day Adventist Church's beliefs regarding the afterlife differ from other Christian churches.,p,3,7,61
22,"Rather than ascend to Heaven or descend to Hell, Adventists believe the dead ""remain unconscious until the return of Christ in judgement"".",p,3,7,61

73,"This ultimate goal is recited in one of the most prominent verses in Quraan, the first Sura in the Quraan, named Alfateha in the 5th verse ""Ehdina al serata al mostaqeem"" meaning ""guide us to the straight path"", and the following verses follows describing this path as ""The way of those on whom you have bestowed your grace, not the way of those who earned your anger, nor of those who went astray"".",p,3,8,63

18,The type of rebirth will be conditioned by the moral tone of the person's actions (kamma or karma).,p,4,10,93
26,"For example, if a person has committed harmful actions of body, speech and mind based on greed, hatred and delusion, rebirth in a lower realm, i.e.",p,4,10,93
13,"an animal, a hungry ghost or a hell realm, is to be expected.",p,4,10,93

28,"This yomi very closely resembles the Greek Hades; however, later myths include notions of resurrection and even Elysium-like descriptions such as in the legend of Okuninushi and Susanoo.",p,5,15,113
17,Shinto tends to hold negative views on death and corpses as a source of pollution called kegare.,p,5,15,113
24,"However, death is also viewed as a path towards apotheosis in Shintoism as can be evidenced by how legendary individuals become enshrined after death.",p,5,15,113
20,Perhaps the most famous would be Emperor Ojin who was enshrined as Hachiman the God of War after his death.,p,5,15,113
2,Unitarian Universalism,h3,5,16,114
21,Some Unitarian Universalists believe in universalism: that all souls will ultimately be saved and that there are no torments of hell.,p,5,16,115
17,Unitarian Universalists differ widely in their theology hence there is no exact same stance on the issue.,p,5,16,115
32,"Although Unitarians historically believed in a literal hell, and Universalists historically believed that everyone goes to heaven, modern Unitarian Universalists can be categorized into those believing in a heaven, reincarnation and oblivion.",p,5,16,115
28,Most Unitarian Universalists believe that heaven and hell are symbolic places of consciousness and the faith is largely focused on the worldly life rather than any possible afterlife.,p,5,16,115
1,Spiritualism,h3,5,17,116
17,"According to Edgar Cayce, the afterlife consisted of nine realms equated with the nine planets of astrology.",p,5,17,117
14,"The first, symbolized by Saturn, was a level for the purification of the souls.",p,5,17,117
14,"The second, Mercury's realm, gives us the ability to consider problems as a whole.",p,5,17,117
18,The third of the nine soul realms is ruled by Earth and is associated with the Earthly pleasures.,p,5,17,117
15,The fourth realm is where we find out about love and is ruled by Venus.,p,5,17,117
14,The fifth realm is where we meet our limitations and is ruled by Mars.,p,5,17,117
24,"The sixth realm is ruled by Neptune, and is where we begin to use our creative powers and free ourselves from the material world.",p,5,17,117
23,"The seventh realm is symbolized by Jupiter, which strengthens the soul's ability to depict situations, to analyze people and places, things, and conditions.",p,5,17,117
12,The eighth afterlife realm is ruled by Uranus and develops psychic ability.,p,5,17,117
14,"The ninth afterlife realm is symbolized by Pluto, the astrological realm of the unconscious.",p,5,17,117
42,"This afterlife realm is a transient place where souls can choose to travel to other realms or other solar systems, it is the souls liberation into eternity, and is the realm that opens the doorway from our solar system into the cosmos.",p,5,17,117
20,Mainstream Spiritualists postulate a series of seven realms that are not unlike Edgar Cayce's nine realms ruled by the planets.,p,5,17,118
18,"As it evolves, the soul moves higher and higher until it reaches the ultimate realm of spiritual oneness.",p,5,17,118
27,"The first realm, equated with hell, is the place where troubled souls spend a long time before they are compelled to move up to the next level.",p,5,17,118
31,"The second realm, where most souls move directly, is thought of as an intermediate transition between the lower planes of life and hell and the higher perfect realms of the universe.",p,5,17,118
13,The third level is for those who have worked with their karmic inheritance.,p,5,17,118
15,The fourth level is that from which evolved souls teach and direct those on Earth.,p,5,17,118
11,The fifth level is where the soul leaves human consciousness behind.,p,5,17,118
21,"At the sixth plane, the soul is finally aligned with the cosmic consciousness and has no sense of separateness or individuality.",p,5,17,118
28,"Finally, the seventh level, the goal of each soul, is where the soul transcends its own sense of ""soulfulness"" and reunites with the World Soul and the universe.",p,5,17,118
1,Wicca,h3,5,18,119
10,The Wiccan afterlife is most commonly described as The Summerland.,p,5,18,120
16,"Here, souls rest, recuperate from life, and reflect on the experiences they had during their lives.",p,5,18,120
18,"After a period of rest, the souls are reincarnated, and the memory of their previous lives is erased.",p,5,18,120
14,Many Wiccans see The Summerland as a place to reflect on their life actions.,p,5,18,120
21,"It is not a place of reward, but rather the end of a life journey at an end point of incarnations.",p,5,18,120
1,Zoroastrianism,h3,5,19,121
28,"Zoroastrianism states that the urvan, the disembodied spirit, lingers on earth for three days before departing downward to the kingdom of the dead that is ruled by Yima.",p,5,19,122
40,"For the three days that it rests on Earth, righteous souls sit at the head of their body, chanting the Ustavaiti Gathas with joy, while a wicked person sits at the feet of the corpse, wails and recites the Yasna.",p,5,19,122
23,"Zoroastrianism states that for the righteous souls, a beautiful maiden, which is the personification of the soul's good thoughts, words and deeds, appears.",p,5,19,122
11,"For a wicked person, a very old, ugly, naked hag appears.",p,5,19,122
26,"After three nights, the soul of the wicked is taken by the demon Vizaresa (Vīzarəša), to Chinvat bridge, and is made to go to darkness (hell).",p,5,19,122
21,"Yima is believed to have been the first king on earth to rule, as well as the first man to die.",p,5,19,123
23,"Inside of Yima's realm, the spirits live a shadowy existence, and are dependent on their own descendants which are still living on Earth.",p,5,19,123
15,"Their descendants are to satisfy their hunger and clothe them, through rituals done on earth.",p,5,19,123
29,"Rituals which are done on the first three days are vital and important, as they protect the soul from evil powers and give it strength to reach the underworld.",p,5,19,124
16,"After three days, the soul crosses Chinvat bridge which is the Final Judgment of the soul.",p,5,19,124
9,Rashnu and Sraosha are present at the final judgment.,p,5,19,124
10,"The list is expanded sometimes, and include Vahman and Ormazd.",p,5,19,124
10,Rashnu is the yazata who holds the scales of justice.,p,5,19,124
16,"If the good deeds of the person outweigh the bad, the soul is worthy of paradise.",p,5,19,124
35,"If the bad deeds outweigh the good, the bridge narrows down to the width of a blade-edge, and a horrid hag pulls the soul in her arms, and takes it down to hell with her.",p,5,19,124
21,"Misvan Gatu is the ""place of the mixed ones"" where the souls lead a gray existence, lacking both joy and sorrow.",p,5,19,125

1,Parapsychology,h2,6,19,126
22,The Society for Psychical Research was founded in 1882 with the express intention of investigating phenomena relating to Spiritualism and the afterlife.,p,6,19,127
13,Its members continue to conduct scientific research on the paranormal to this day.,p,6,19,127
23,Some of the earliest attempts to apply scientific methods to the study of phenomena relating to an afterlife were conducted by this organization.,p,6,19,127
18,"Its earliest members included noted scientists like William Crookes, and philosophers such as Henry Sidgwick and William James.",p,6,19,127
21,"Parapsychological investigation of the afterlife includes the study of haunting, apparitions of the deceased, instrumental trans-communication, electronic voice phenomena, and mediumship.",p,6,19,128
26,"A study conducted in 1901 by physician Duncan MacDougall sought to measure the weight lost by a human when the soul ""departed the body"" upon death.",p,6,19,129
18,"MacDougall weighed dying patients in an attempt to prove that the soul was material, tangible and thus measurable.",p,6,19,129
23,"Although MacDougall's results varied considerably from ""21 grams"", for some people this figure has become synonymous with the measure of a soul's mass.",p,6,19,129
14,The title of the 2003 movie 21 Grams is a reference to MacDougall's findings.,p,6,19,129
23,"His results have never been reproduced, and are generally regarded either as meaningless or considered to have had little if any scientific merit.",p,6,19,129
26,"Frank Tipler has argued that physics can explain immortality, although such arguments are not falsifiable and, in Karl Popper's views, they do not qualify as science.",p,6,19,130
28,"After 25 years of parapsychological research Susan Blackmore came to the conclusion that, according to her experiences, there is not enough empirical evidence for many of these cases.",p,6,19,131
1,Mediumship,h3,6,20,132
23,"There are mediums who claim to have contacts to deceased people; examples of these mediums include Tyler Henry, Pascal Voggenhuber and many more.",p,6,20,133
3,Near death research,h3,6,21,134
10,Research also includes the study of the near death experience.,p,6,21,135

1,Philosophy,h2,7,21,136
2,Modern philosophy,h3,7,22,137
18,"There is a view based on the philosophical question of personal identity, termed open individualism by Daniel Kolak.",p,7,22,138
22,"It concludes that individual conscious experience is illusory, and because consciousness continues after death in all conscious beings, you do not die.",p,7,22,138
15,This position has been supported by notable physicists such as Erwin Schrödinger and Freeman Dyson.,p,7,22,138
13,Certain problems arise with the idea of a particular person continuing after death.,p,7,22,139
19,"Peter van Inwagen, in his argument regarding resurrection, notes that the materialist must have some sort of physical continuity.",p,7,22,139
35,"John Hick also raises some questions regarding personal identity in his book, Death and Eternal Life using an example of a person ceasing to exist in one place while an exact replica appears in another.",p,7,22,139
29,"If the replica had all the same experiences, traits, and physical appearances of the first person, we would all attribute the same identity to the second, according to Hick.",p,7,22,139
2,Process philosophy,h3,7,23,140
35,"In the panentheistic model of process philosophy and theology the writers Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne rejected that the universe was made of substance, instead reality is composed of living experiences (occasions of experience).",p,7,23,141
33,"According to Hartshorne people do not experience subjective (or personal) immortality in the afterlife, but they do have objective immortality because their experiences live on forever in God, who contains all that was.",p,7,23,141
19,However other process philosophers such as David Ray Griffin have written that people may have subjective experience after death.,p,7,23,141

22,"Psychological proposals for the origin of a belief in an afterlife include cognitive disposition, cultural learning, and as an intuitive religious idea.",p,8,23,143
32,"In one study, children were able to recognize the ending of physical, mental, and perceptual activity in death, but were hesitant to conclude the ending of will, self, or emotion in death.",p,8,23,143
27,"In 2008, a large-scale study conducted by the University of Southampton involving 2060 patients from 15 hospitals in the United Kingdom, United States and Austria was launched.",p,8,23,144
17,The AWARE (AWAreness during REsuscitation) study examined the broad range of mental experiences in relation to death.,p,8,23,144
35,"In a large study, researchers also tested the validity of conscious experiences for the first time using objective markers, to determine whether claims of awareness compatible with out-of-body experiences correspond with real or hallucinatory events.",p,8,23,144
28,The results revealed that 40% of those who survived a cardiac arrest were aware during the time that they were clinically dead and before their hearts were restarted.,p,8,23,144
35,"One patient also had a verified out-of-body experience (over 80% of patients did not survive their cardiac arrest or were too sick to be interviewed), but his cardiac arrest occurred in a room without markers.",p,8,23,144
1,Dr.,p,8,23,144
37,"Parnia in the interview stated, ""The evidence thus far suggests that in the first few minutes after death, consciousness is not annihilated."" The study continues in AWARE II, which is set to be completed in September 2020.",p,8,23,144
14,Studies have also been done on the widely reported phenomenon of Near Death Experiences.,p,8,23,145
27,Experiencers commonly report being transported to a different “realm” or “plane of existence” and they have been shown to display a lasting positive aftereffect on most experiencers.,p,8,23,145
