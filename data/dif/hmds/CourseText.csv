59954,What does the acronym ?HMDS? stand for?
59951,"WARNINGWhen working with any decontaminant, take appropriate measures to avoid getting the substance into the eyes and mouth or onto the skin. In the event of eye, mouth, or skin contact, refer to the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for emergencies or first aid. WARNINGLiquids deployed by this system may be slippery. Every effort should be made to control accidental slippage and to avoid walking on areas where liquid has been spilled and/or applied. WARNINGNEVER operate the HMDS if an air line or discharge hose is worn/damaged, or if an air leak has been discovered. Once pressurized, a loose/leaking/damaged connection and/or hose may disconnect or rupture, potentially causing serious injury. WARNINGALWAYS treat the HMDS as though the discharge line(s) are pressurized. Once the system is pressurized, it will remain so until the air supply is turned off and the system is completely depressurized. A depressurized system can be identified by examining the air pressure gauge or the lack of a hissing sound. WARNINGALWAYS ensure that all connections, hoses, and nozzles are tightly attached while operating the HMDS. ALWAYS point all discharge devices in a safe direction."

59952,"WARNINGThe HMDS engine runs on diesel fuel. Observe all applicable precautions when handling, storing, or dispensing fuels. WARNINGThe Power Unit uses a 12V DC battery to supply electrical energy to the starter. To mitigate risks associated with the battery/charging system, do not remove or install any cables while the system is running or energized. Never allow any object to touch metal components in the battery box or other electrical components. WARNINGDisconnect all battery cables before servicing the HMDS engine. WARNINGSome parts of this system, especially the exhaust system, may be hot to the touch during and after operation. NEVER attempt to service internal components while the HMDS is running! Once the system is shut down, allow adequate time for components to cool before attempting to service any internal components. WARNINGThe operator shall have a firm grip and wide stance while discharging a hose from a spray nozzle. The HMDS propels solutions with significant force! Once the system is pressurized, never release the hose prior to closing the discharge nozzle/D-bale hand set and/or the Pump Control valve. A loose discharge hose will whip around violently and can cause serious injury or equipment damage. Always close the Pump Control valve on the Power Unit's Control Panel and relieve pressure from the discharge line before releasing the hose."

59953,"WARNINGPersonnel using the HMDS must be trained in the basic principles of decontamination in order to mitigate the risks of performing these inherently dangerous operations. WARNINGThe HMDS uses pressurized air (~100 psi) as an energy source to both create and propel decontamination solutions onto a target. Before operation, always verify that all hoses and accessories are properly connected. Always inspect the unit to ensure that the integrity of air lines and liquid hoses are not compromised and are serviceable In Accordance With (IAW) the Preventive Maintenance Checks and Services (PMCS) guidance set forth in this course. After operation, always turn off the Tank Drain Valves and discharge any fluids/pressure in the hose(s). Failure to do so can result in injury and/or system damage. WARNINGThe HMDS deploys various chemical and/or biological decontamination solutions. Operators must be fully trained in this type of operation.

60208,"The High Mobility Decontamination System (HMDS) is a modular, diesel-driven system specifically designed for rapid, mobile decontamination missions for terrain and military equipment. The system is designed to be operated while mounted in the back of a M1083 vehicle or on a M1095 trailer, while stationary or mobile. The HMDS Power Unit uses a Diesel engine-powered air compressor to create and propel decontamination solutions through a 1.5"" (3.81cm) pump. It deploys these solutions through vehicle- or trailer-mounted spray bars, a remote-control stanchion-mounted Monitor (water cannon), and non-collapsible hoses with D-Bale handset(s).  The HMDS is capable of drafting from external water sources, such as bulk tanks or natural bodies of water. In addition to the Power Unit, the HMDS incorporates two solution-mixing tanks, each with a fill capacity of 750 gallons. The tanks are constructed with internal baffles to minimize liquid movement and weight shift during transport."

The fuel container also uses a fuel line/cap that includes a fuel level indicator. ?F? denotes full, ?E? denotes empty. There is a check valve at the bottom of the siphon tube on the fuel cap system. It will help reduce the loss of fuel prime to the engine, making startups after storage or transportation easier. WARNING!Avoid allowing the fuel level to fall below ? tank.

60229,"The Front Spray Bar (FSB) is used to disperse fluid from the front of a truck. It is made of stainless steel and is fed by the 1"" diameter Green Banded hose. The middle section is 98"" long and comes equipped with mounting brackets, as well as two capped ends that are used to attach the right- and left- ?wings.?  The mounting brackets are set up to mount the FSB to armored M1083 trucks. The bracket must be inverted in order to mount the FSB to the unarmored versions of the M1083 trucks. Two (2) 1"" diameter clevis pins are used to hold the brackets onto the clevis fittings on the front of the truck.  Without the extension wings, the FSB will cover approximately 16' (wide). Ensure that the caps with gaskets are in place and locked down. Failure to do so will result in liquid spraying up the side(s) of the truck.  The right- and left-wings extend the FSB?s overall length by 4' each (8' overall), for a total spray pattern that is approximately 32' wide. The right wing is marked with an ?R? and red bands, while the left wing is marked with an ?L? and green bands. To avoid damaging the FSB or the vehicle, each wing can swivel backwards if it strikes an object.  To add the wings to the FSB, detach the camlock caps on each end of the middle section. Then, attach the wings using the Instalock fittings. Make certain that there is a rubber gasket in the fitting or the FSB won?t operate properly.  The center nozzles on the middle spray bar and the inner nozzles on the wings point approximately 45 degrees forward from the vertical. The outer nozzles on the wings point outward and downward."

60226,"The Monitor is a water cannon used for large area/long distance decontamination. It can be configured to operate either manually or with the wired Remote-Control Box. There are 2 manual- control hand wheel knobs on the Monitor that can be used to move it if there is no power being supplied. It is made of stainless steel and is fed by the 17' long, 1.5"" diameter, Purple Banded hose via an EZLink connector.  The Monitor is comprised of three (3) major components: the Monitor head, a ?haloed? Stanchion to protect the Monitor head, and a wired Remote-Control Box.  Selector Valve #2 on the Power Unit has two functions related to the Monitor:  Monitor: This setting allows liquid to flow to the Monitor constantly once the Pump Control Valve is opened.  Remote Monitor: This setting causes the flow of water to be controlled by the wired Remote-Control Box. Liquid will begin to flow to the Monitor when the switch on the controller is engaged, and will immediately stop when the switch is released. The nozzle control switch (?Fog/Stream?) controls the ?blabber? actuator on the Stream & Fog nozzle; the ?stream? is a straight flow of liquid, whereas the ?fog? is of lower pressure, and fan shaped."
60220,"The stainless steel Hopper/Blender is used to aid in mixing powdered, liquid, and granular decontaminant materials into a tank. It has a 16"" diameter and the funnel section is 22"" deep. It has a plastic lid, which is attached by a lanyard, and a removable stainless steel screen. The screen has a handle on top and several 1"" diameter holes across its surface. The holes assist with breaking up clumps of powdered or granular decontaminant that could clog the 1.5"" diameter funnel output spout.  The Hopper/Blender is primarily fed by a 1.5"" EZLink camlock fitting on the White Banded Hopper Hose. Alternatively, it can be fed by the Red Banded Discharge Hoses, or any other 1.5"" diameter hose in the HMDS hose kit. The Hopper/Blender is located next to the Agitator and has two (2) 1/2"" stainless steel bars in the funnel section. These bars support the removable screen and help prevent objects from accidentally falling into the tank. If there are ?clumps? of decontaminant on the bars or screen, use a disposable dipstick made of wood or plastic (supplied by the unit) to break them down to a size which will allow the clumps to feed through the screen.  WARNING! DO NOT use a hammer, metal objects, or excessive force that could cause damage to the Hopper.  If ?clumps? are not easily breakable, simply remove them from the Hopper. WARNING! Avoid sticking fingers or gloved hands into the screen holes, as this may result in serious cuts."

60217,"The HMDS has two 750-gallon tanks with incorporated skids. Tank Specifications:Weight (empty): ~1,000 lbs.  Weight (full of water): ~7,500 lbs.  Overall Dimensions (with skid, without storage basket): 92"" L x 80"" W x 43.5"" H Actual Dimensions of the Tank (outside-to-outside): 68"" L x 78"" W x 36"" H   The tanks are built using a 4-way, modular platform skid design which allows for 360-degree forklifting capability. EMPTY tanks can also be lifted from underneath with a forklift, using extended forks or slings and an overhead crane or wrecker. They can be loaded from either the rear or the sides of transport vehicles.  Both tanks have an approximate 13"" notched bottom lip (skid cutouts to the front to accommodate the monitor) on the front ends, which butts the tank against the front wall of the truck bed. This helps in preventing slippage and damage to the tank itself.  Each tank is equipped with a Hopper/Blender assembly and fill connection, Agitator assembly and fill connection, tank level indicator port, and a ball valve fluid output/drain with a 1.5"" camlock. WARNING! Although the tanks are sturdy and supported with internal baffles, do not stand on them! They may become very slippery and can create a slip and fall hazard."

The brackets are equipped with 1"" diameter clevis pins to fasten the RSB brackets to the rear clevis fixtures on the truck or the trailer. When mounted on the back of a truck, the RSB can be fed by a single 1"" diameter Orange Banded hose. However, when the RSB is mounted to the back of a trailer, both Orange Banded hoses must be connected using a 1"" male-male adapter in order to reach the Power Unit. The central nozzles on the RSB point downward (near vertical) and the outer nozzles point outward from the sides. There is a bolt on the bottom of each of the two RSB brackets that the operator can use to adjust the angle of the RSB.

The second, pictured below the first, with the LONG extension will be mounted on the REAR of either the truck or trailer.  The slide is designed to keep the spray bar from rolling down and must be butted against the trailer by the locked down slide to keep it from doing so. The slide will be retracted and tightened down for placement on the rear of the truck. The slide will be extended and locked down for placement on the trailer. Ensure the slide bolt is tight. Check periodically and re-tighten if rolling starts to occur. Non-armored vehicles may require the installer to disassemble and invert the truck side of the adjustable slide bracket. The Front Spray Bar (FSB) is equipped with two capped ends that enable the attachment of extensions, sometimes called ?outriggers? or ?wings?, to provide a significantly wider spray pattern. The wings are marked with red markings and an ""R"" on the right side, and green markings and an ""L"" on the left side.  The orientation of the nozzles on the wings are important for correct function of the spray bars; the slots should be in line with the long axis of the bars. Attach the wings using the Instalock camlock fittings and ensure there is a rubber gasket in each of them for correct sealing and seating. Each wing will swivel rearward if it strikes a fixed item while the vehicle is moving. The gasket may need to be replaced often due to wear on the part."

60273,"Secure the tank to the bed of the truck or trailer in the following manner. Refer to the diagram for the authorized tie down procedure. Three (3) 10,000 lb. cargo tie-down ratchet straps are used on the tank and passed over the tank at the guides, welded to the top of the tank.  The guides correspond to D-Rings on the truck/trailer bed.  The tank?s notched front lip must be butted up against the front wall of the truck/trailer bed; the lip prevents the tank from shifting forward in a sudden braking event.   Attach the free, hooked end of the strap on the driver?s side and run the straps over the guides and under the storage basket to secure. Attach the ratchet end of the strap on the passenger side of the vehicle or trailer.  Check each strap for tightness as part of the system's daily PMCS.   WARNING! Always follow the manufacturer?s instructions on how to securely restrain all HMDS components to the transport platform before transportation of any kind. Failure to do so may result in damage to equipment, injury, or death!"

60402,"WARNING!Please note that antifreeze should NEVER be used with Super Tropical Bleach. The reaction between these materials will release a significant amount of heat or flames that may damage the system.   WARNING! Always wear proper PPE when dispensing decontaminate.  CAUTION: The Agitator and the Hopper/Blender hoses will contain slurry. Rinse and clean out the tanks, hoses, and any fittings thoroughly before properly storing them. CAUTION: You can still operate the Hopper/Blender, but it may introduce more air in the slurry mixture and cause foaming after mixing. CAUTION: The Agitator and the Hopper/Blender hoses will contain slurry. Rinse and clean out these hoses and any fittings thoroughly before storing them in the tank basket. CAUTION: After the slurry is blended, it must be agitated constantly until used. It is useful to agitate with both the Agitator and the Hopper/Blender. Use the ?Agitator? function on Selector Valve #1 and ?Monitor? on Selector Valve #2. Then, route the Monitor hose (Purple Band) or a short discharge hose (Double Red Band) to the Hopper/Blender. The alternate is to use the #2 Discharge port to the Hopper/Blender with a Double Red Banded hose. Decide which method you will use in advance, as to avoid changing over hoses and connections. After blending is complete, replace the tank lid. Agitate the slurry mixture and avoid adding air with the Agitator to reduce foaming."

60276,"The 8' long Spray Bars are designed to be universally fit-enabled by an adjustable slide bracket mechanism. This allows for up to 2? of lateral adjustability during installation. This mechanism also allows for interchangeability between the Front Spray Bar (FSB) mounts on the M1083 variants. The spray bars are held in place with the clevis pins on the shackle mounts. The spray bars themselves are designed with four (4) ?"", 80-degree fan spray tips. Each tip produces ~60 psi of pressure. The FSB also has attachable ?wings? or outriggers to extend the spraying pattern wider (up to 32' wide) using a total of 8 fan spray tips/nozzles. The Rear Spray Bar (RSB) is also a universal fit. It can be mounted on the rear of the M1083 FMTV style trucks and the M1095 series trailers.  WARNING! NEVER stand on the spray bars. Doing so may cause injury and/or system damage."

The Stanchion can be mounted in any one of the four (4) davit pockets on the M1083 truck bed. It can be placed in the davit in any position desired. Ensure that the pin for the davit pocket is used for the Stanchion. Position the Monitor?s tank input to point towards the Power Unit to avoid kinks in the hose. The ?halo? on the top of the Stanchion serves to protect and act as a lifting handle for the Monitor. The Monitor can be operated either manually or by the wired Remote-Control Box. It can be operated while dismounted or from inside the truck?s cab.  The Monitor Electrical Connector on the back of the Power Unit supplies power (12 VDC) to the Monitor and its controller. It also establishes the connection to turn the water flow on/off while the system is in ""Remote Monitor"" mode."
