60217,"The HMDS has two 750-gallon tanks with incorporated skids. Tank Specifications:Weight (empty): ~1,000 lbs.  Weight (full of water): ~7,500 lbs.  Overall Dimensions (with skid, without storage basket): 92"" L x 80"" W x 43.5"" H Actual Dimensions of the Tank (outside-to-outside): 68"" L x 78"" W x 36"" H   The tanks are built using a 4-way, modular platform skid design which allows for 360-degree forklifting capability. EMPTY tanks can also be lifted from underneath with a forklift, using extended forks or slings and an overhead crane or wrecker. They can be loaded from either the rear or the sides of transport vehicles.  Both tanks have an approximate 13"" notched bottom lip (skid cutouts to the front to accommodate the monitor) on the front ends, which butts the tank against the front wall of the truck bed. This helps in preventing slippage and damage to the tank itself.  Each tank is equipped with a Hopper/Blender assembly and fill connection, Agitator assembly and fill connection, tank level indicator port, and a ball valve fluid output/drain with a 1.5"" camlock. WARNING! Although the tanks are sturdy and supported with internal baffles, do not stand on them! They may become very slippery and can create a slip and fall hazard.",71530,System Tanks,/-1(*)/01(*)/08(*)/00(*),High Mobility Decontamination System (HMDS) | System Overview | System Tanks | System Tanks

60220,"The stainless steel Hopper/Blender is used to aid in mixing powdered, liquid, and granular decontaminant materials into a tank. It has a 16"" diameter and the funnel section is 22"" deep. It has a plastic lid, which is attached by a lanyard, and a removable stainless steel screen. The screen has a handle on top and several 1"" diameter holes across its surface. The holes assist with breaking up clumps of powdered or granular decontaminant that could clog the 1.5"" diameter funnel output spout.  The Hopper/Blender is primarily fed by a 1.5"" EZLink camlock fitting on the White Banded Hopper Hose. Alternatively, it can be fed by the Red Banded Discharge Hoses, or any other 1.5"" diameter hose in the HMDS hose kit. The Hopper/Blender is located next to the Agitator and has two (2) 1/2"" stainless steel bars in the funnel section. These bars support the removable screen and help prevent objects from accidentally falling into the tank. If there are ?clumps? of decontaminant on the bars or screen, use a disposable dipstick made of wood or plastic (supplied by the unit) to break them down to a size which will allow the clumps to feed through the screen.  WARNING! DO NOT use a hammer, metal objects, or excessive force that could cause damage to the Hopper.  If ?clumps? are not easily breakable, simply remove them from the Hopper. WARNING!

60273,"Secure the tank to the bed of the truck or trailer in the following manner. Refer to the diagram for the authorized tie down procedure. Three (3) 10,000 lb. cargo tie-down ratchet straps are used on the tank and passed over the tank at the guides, welded to the top of the tank.  The guides correspond to D-Rings on the truck/trailer bed.  The tank?s notched front lip must be butted up against the front wall of the truck/trailer bed; the lip prevents the tank from shifting forward in a sudden braking event.   Attach the free, hooked end of the strap on the driver?s side and run the straps over the guides and under the storage basket to secure. Attach the ratchet end of the strap on the passenger side of the vehicle or trailer.  Check each strap for tightness as part of the system's daily PMCS.   WARNING! Always follow the manufacturer?s instructions on how to securely restrain all HMDS components to the transport platform before transportation of any kind.

60276,"The 8' long Spray Bars are designed to be universally fit-enabled by an adjustable slide bracket mechanism. This allows for up to 2? of lateral adjustability during installation. This mechanism also allows for interchangeability between the Front Spray Bar (FSB) mounts on the M1083 variants. The spray bars are held in place with the clevis pins on the shackle mounts. The spray bars themselves are designed with four (4) ?"", 80-degree fan spray tips. Each tip produces ~60 psi of pressure. The FSB also has attachable ?wings? or outriggers to extend the spraying pattern wider (up to 32' wide) using a total of 8 fan spray tips/nozzles. The Rear Spray Bar (RSB) is also a universal fit. It can be mounted on the rear of the M1083 FMTV style trucks and the M1095 series trailers.  WARNING! NEVER stand on the spray bars. Doing so may cause injury and/or system damage.",71613,Installation of Spray Bars,/-1(*)/02(*)/06(*)/00(*),High Mobility Decontamination System (HMDS) | System Setup and PMCS | Installation of Spray Bars | Installation of Spray Bars

60277,"There are 2 different universal spray bar mounts. The one pictured with the SHORT extension will ALWAYS be mounted on the FRONT of the truck ONLY. The second, pictured below the first, with the LONG extension will be mounted on the REAR of either the truck or trailer.  The slide is designed to keep the spray bar from rolling down and must be butted against the trailer by the locked down slide to keep it from doing so. The slide will be retracted and tightened down for placement on the rear of the truck. The slide will be extended and locked down for placement on the trailer. Ensure the slide bolt is tight. Check periodically and re-tighten if rolling starts to occur. Non-armored vehicles may require the installer to disassemble and invert the truck side of the adjustable slide bracket. The Front Spray Bar (FSB) is equipped with two capped ends that enable the attachment of extensions, sometimes called ?outriggers? or ?wings?, to provide a significantly wider spray pattern. The wings are marked with red markings and an ""R"" on the right side, and green markings and an ""L"" on the left side.  The orientation of the nozzles on the wings are important for correct function of the spray bars; the slots should be in line with the long axis of the bars. Attach the wings using the Instalock camlock fittings and ensure there is a rubber gasket in each of them for correct sealing and seating. Each wing will swivel rearward if it strikes a fixed item while the vehicle is moving. The gasket may need to be replaced often due to wear on the part.",71614,Installation of Spray Bars (continued),/-1(*)/02(*)/06(*)/01(*),High Mobility Decontamination System (HMDS) | System Setup and PMCS | Installation of Spray Bars | Installation of Spray Bars (continued)

60402,"WARNING!Please note that antifreeze should NEVER be used with Super Tropical Bleach. The reaction between these materials will release a significant amount of heat or flames that may damage the system.   WARNING! Always wear proper PPE when dispensing decontaminate.  CAUTION: The Agitator and the Hopper/Blender hoses will contain slurry. Rinse and clean out the tanks, hoses, and any fittings thoroughly before properly storing them. CAUTION: You can still operate the Hopper/Blender, but it may introduce more air in the slurry mixture and cause foaming after mixing. CAUTION: The Agitator and the Hopper/Blender hoses will contain slurry. Rinse and clean out these hoses and any fittings thoroughly before storing them in the tank basket. CAUTION: After the slurry is blended, it must be agitated constantly until used. It is useful to agitate with both the Agitator and the Hopper/Blender. Use the ?Agitator? function on Selector Valve #1 and ?Monitor? on Selector Valve #2. Then, route the Monitor hose (Purple Band) or a short discharge hose (Double Red Band) to the Hopper/Blender. The alternate is to use the #2 Discharge port to the Hopper/Blender with a Double Red Banded hose. Decide which method you will use in advance, as to avoid changing over hoses and connections. After blending is complete, replace the tank lid.

Slurry can be applied to surfaces such as roads, airfields, parking aprons, pier sides, and taxiways. It is used primarily for terrain decontamination. NOTE:Contact Unit Maintenance prior to mixing slurry, as you will need to temporarily replace the Air Check valve with a ?"" NPT galvanized iron plug (located in the storage case). The Air Check valve is located inside the Power Unit, on top of the pump module, underneath the Battery Box. Use Teflon sealing paste (e.g., Blue Monster) or Teflon tape to aid in sealing the plug and making removal easier at the end of the mission. It is not necessary to remove the Air Check valve, let it hang free with the air tubing still attached. Simply turn off the Air Control valve on the control panel as you will not need to add air to make certain types of slurry.

60407,"Single TankWhen using only the truck tank to mix slurry, the unit will need to supply water for mixing from an external source, such as a blivet, drop tank, tank/pump unit, hydrant, or natural source. Make the mixing connections the same way as for the truck tank configuration, but the system will draft water vertically or horizontally to fill water into the mixing tank.  Keep in mind that you cannot perform any other functions (i.e., agitation, mixing with the Monitor/discharge outlets) while drafting in through the drafting port and out through the draft outlet port.  Use the Vertical Draft hose (Single Blue Band) to draw water from sources below the level of the truck tires up to the Power Unit and into the main (truck) tank.  Use the Horizontal Drafting hose (Double Blue Bands) to draw water horizontally from a drop tank or blivet (Same elevation or level as the truck tires).  NOTE: To extend the horizontal drafting distance, connect the Suction Trailer (Double Black Bands) hose using the 1.5"" x 1.5"" male-to-male connector to the Horizontal Drafting hose.

Use the inspection/clean out ports to reach inside the tank.Flush the tank with clean water.Dispose of all wastewater appropriately, according to which chemicals were used.Repeat this procedure until the tank is thoroughly cleaned. Any residual chemicals may harden and cause a clog. Special techniques to clear clogs or to remove decontaminant residue from the tanks include: Use a ?? to ?? shaper tip nozzle to shoot water into clogs/residue.A pressure washer may be required to assist with cleaning off large amounts of decontaminant.Agitate the tank using clean water when flushing the tank. Add air to the Agitator to clear clogs.If the Main Tank Drain Valve becomes clogged, back flush the Main Tank Drain Valve using a 1.5? hose and any of the 1.5? discharge functions.With the Hopper/Blender removed, shovel out any large chunks of decontaminant and dispose of them per unit environmental procedures.",71732,Tank Cleaning Procedure,/-1(*)/06(*)/05(*)/00(*),High Mobility Decontamination System (HMDS) | Maintaining the System | Tank Cleaning Procedure | Tank Cleaning Procedure

Refill/replace with clean fuel, if required.Check the fuel pickup for obstructions. If air can?t flow through the lines, neither can fuel. Check the fuel line connections on the back of the Power Unit. If contaminated fuel is suspected, change the fuel supply and empty the water/fuel separator. Shut the system down and allow the system to cool. DO NOT check oil levels until the oil has had time to drain back into the pan. Verify the oil drain valve is in the closed position. Note the last time the oil and oil filter were changed and change them, if required. While the system is shutdown, check the wiring to and from the indicator light. Verify there are no loose connections and blow out any excess moisture. Shut the system down and allow it to cool. DO NOT attempt to check/add coolant until the system has cooled down and coolant has drained back to the reservoirs. Once the system is  cool, open the radiator cap to verify coolant levels. Add fluid to the cooling tank, as required. Inspect the coolant reservoir and ensure the coolant is at the proper level. While the system is shutdown, check the air filter. Clean or replace the filter, if required. Ensure the system has sufficient air flow to and around the unit. Once the system is restarted, observe the cooling fan to ensure it is engaging (coming on) to cool the system. If not, you could have a belt problem. Fuel flow can be restricted/interrupted in numerous ways. Check the fuel supply, and replace if required. Verify that the pickup is not clogged. Check the fuel line connections from the supply to the HMDS. Note the last time the fuel filter was changed and replace it, if required. Check the fuel/water separator and drain it, if required. Shut the system down and allow the system to cool. DO NOT attempt to check or add compressor oil until the system has had time to drain the oil back into the reservoirs.
