52548,"Pre-Start Procedures The following steps will instruct you on how to execute Pre-Start Procedures for the RIB: WARNING: To avoid falling from the sides, rear, or top of the boat, always maintain three points of contact ? such as both feet and one hand ? when climbing in, out, and on the boat. Failure to comply may result in injury. Secure and stow all equipment.Remove the retaining strap (Item 1) and raise the dive mast (Item 2) to a vertical position.Rotate the lock lever (Item 3) to approximately 90? and lock the mast (Item 2) into position.Rotate the lock lever (Item 1) to approximately 90? and unlock the antenna (Item 2).Raise the antenna (Item 2) to a vertical position.Rotate the lock lever (Item 1) to approximately 90? and lock the antenna (Item 2) into position.Remove the radome canvas cover.Raise the radome mast into an upright position and replace the radome canvas cover.Engage the two turnbuckle fasteners and secure the radome mast.Verify that the port and starboard engine throttle levers are in the NEUTRAL position.Turn port, starboard, and house battery switches to Position 1.Verify that the house, 24 hour power, port engine, and starboard engine alternator breakers are in the UN-TRIPPED position. NOTE: The breaker is in the UN-TRIPPED position when the yellow RESET arm is in line with the breaker housing. If the yellow RESET arm is at a 30? angle from the breaker housing and the word ?RESET? is visible, the breaker is in the TRIPPED position.    13. Ensure that all control switches are in the ON position. WARNING: Vapor from fuel is heavier than air and will flow to the lowest part of the boat. Ventilate bilges for at least five minutes prior to starting engines. Failure to comply may result in damage to equipment, injury, or death.    14.

Failure to comply may result in damage to the trailer. At the staging area, remove the two bow ratchet tie downs (Item 1) and two stern ratchet tie downs (Item 2) from the boat and trailer. Stow the tie downs in the trailer tool box.Inspect the bilge plug and transom plug to ensure that they are in place. If loose, use a wrench to tighten them.Trim the engines to the full UP position.Disconnect the electrical cable from the prime mover.Disengage the engine lock levers (Item 1). NOTE: The lock lever shown is for the starboard engine. Disengagement is identical for the port engine. WARNING: When parked on a ramp during launching, ensure that the primary mover?s emergency brake is engaged. Failure to comply may result in injury or death. CAUTION: Ensure that the slope of the ramp is not a greater incline than the tow vehicle can overcome with a boat loaded. Ensure that the water depth is deep enough to float the boat. Failure to comply may result in damage to equipment.      6. Move the trailered boat into position on the ramp until approximately 18-24 in. of the forward end of the bunk            is exposed above the water.       7. Ensure that the boat operator and assistant are on board.     8. Attach the mooring lines to the fore and aft cleats. CAUTION: Ensure that there is adequate clearance between the engine and the ramp prior to trimming the engines. Failure to comply may result in damage to equipment.       9. Trim the engines down until the lower gear case is completely submerged.   10. Perform starting procedures.   11. Have an assistant disengage the winch lock lever and rotate the winch handle counter clockwise to loosen line. WARNING: Hold the winch handle firmly when the ratchet is unlocked to prevent spinning. Failure to comply may result in injury.   CAUTION: Do not disconnect the winch cable from the boat until the boat floats free from the trailer. Failure to comply may result in damage to equipment.    12. Have an assistant disconnect the snatch block from the boat bow eye.   CAUTION: Ensure that the launch ramp has adequate water depth to float the boat and trim the engines down. Failure to comply may result in damage to equipment.      13. The trailer may need to be backed further into the water to sufficiently float the boat free from the trailer.   14. As the boat is launched, observe how far the trailer is in the water to assist with recovery.   15. Place the throttle levers in REVERSE and slowly maneuver the boat off of the trailer while adjusting the trim as               necessary.    16.

52592,"Trimming Engines Procedure The following steps will instruct you on how to properly trim the engines: CAUTION: Do not over trim the outboard engines while underway. Over trimming will cause the propellers to exit the water. A rapid increase in the outboard engines RPMs is evidence of cavitation or propellers coming out of the water. If this occurs, immediately reduce throttles and trim down the engines. Failure to comply will result in damage to equipment.The trim of the boat is the relationship between the angle of the outboard engines and the transom. Trim dictates the way the boat performs over the water and gains the greatest power and efficiency of the outboard engines as it relates to the boat. Different sea states will influence the trim levels to achieve the best planning and maneuverability of the boat. When trimming the engines underway, trim both engines using only the trim control switch (Item 1).When operating in shallow waters, trim the engines UP and slow the speed.When accelerating, first ensure the engines are timed fully DOWN. Then, adjust the trim of the engines UP to achieve the best handling for the boat.If the bow is too low, the outboard engines are trimmed too far DOWN. Trim the engines UP to correct this situation.If the bow is too high, the outboard engines are trimmed too far UP.

Failure to comply may result in damage to equipment. NOTE: Docking procedures as outlined may change due to different environmental factors. Adjustments to docking procedures will be dictated by dock arrangement, boat traffic, weather, and sea state. Place the throttle in the FORWARD IDLE position and approach the docking point at a 45? angle.Position the boat with the bow alongside the dock and place the throttle levers in the NEUTRAL position. NOTE: If mooring lines were removed during operation, they may need to be reattached to the forward and aft cleats.      3. Have an assistant pass the bow line to the dock, secure the line to a forward boat cleat, and then secure the line          to the dock.      4.

52595,"Preparing to Anchor Procedure The following steps will instruct you on how to properly prepare to anchor a RIB: To begin, you must first understand the concept of Scope. Scope is the length of the anchor line relative to the distance from the boat cleat to the water bottom. As the scope increases, the horizontal pull on the anchor will also increase, burying the anchor deeper into the sea bottom. As the scope decreases, the horizontal pull will also decrease, causing the anchor to become vertical and possibly dislodged from the sea bottom. A 5-to-1 scope is recommended for proper anchoring. As an example, 5 ft. of anchor line would be required for every 1 ft of water depth. CAUTION: A scope of less than 5-to-1 will significantly decrease the anchor?s holding power. Failure to comply could result in damage to equipment.Ensure that the anchor chain is firmly fastened to the anchor line prior to dropping anchor. Failure to comply could result in loss of equipment. Have an assistant remove the anchor and anchor line from the bow compartment. WARNING: Never attach the anchor line to any rail, rail fitting, or other deck hardware. Failure to comply could result in damage to equipment or injury.      2. Attach the anchor line to the port or starboard mid-cleat.     3. Place the anchor and coil anchor line near bow to prevent knotting and fouling when dropping anchor.     4. Position the boat heading into the wind or current.     5. Approach the anchoring site at idle speed.     6. Turn the navigation lights switch to the ANCHOR position.     7.

52621,"Recovery by Trailer Procedure The following steps will instruct you on how to properly complete a recovery by trailer: Disconnect the electrical cable (Item 3) from the prime mover.Have an assistant rotate the winch lock lever (Item 1) 90? and rotate the winch handle (Item 4) counter-clockwise to loosen the line (Item 2). WARNING: Ensure that the primary mover is placed in park with the emergency brake engaged. Failure to comply may result in damage to equipment, injury, or death.        3. Have the trailer and prime mover in position on the ramp with approximately 18-24 in. of forward end of bunk            exposed above the water. CAUTION: Do not accelerate up the trailer bunks faster than is required. Failure to comply may cause damage to the trailer and boat. NOTE: If the mooring lines were removed during operation, they may need to be reattached to the forward and aft cleats. Account for the wind and current during a trailer?s approach. The operator may ease in and out of gear several times between starting to and eventually touching onto trailer bunks.      4. Trim the engines to 25% and approach the recovery site with throttles in the FORWARD IDLE position while                    maneuvering the boat in line with the center of the trailer.     5. The hull will self-align as it moves up the bunks. If the hull is off center or sideways, ease into reverse and back            the boat down until the hull aligns with the bunks.     6. Place the throttle levers in the NEUTRAL position and have two assistants use the attached mooring lines to                  guide the boat onto the trailer.       7. Have an assistant connect the snatch block to the boat?s bow eye.     8. Have an assistant rotate the winch lock lever 90?. Rotate the winch handle clockwise to tighten the line.     9. Winch the boat forward until it is firmly seated onto the stop bumpers.   10. Place the start/stop switches in the STOP position. CAUTION: Engines must be trimmed to the full UP position prior to removing the boat from the water. Failure to comply may cause damage to engines.     11. Trim the engines to the full UP position. WARNING: The boat is not designed to house passengers during over-the-road transportation. All personnel must depart prior to moving a trailered boat. Failure to comply may result in injury or death.     12. Have all personnel disembark the boat.    13. Using the prime mover, move the trailered boat from the ramp to the staging area and remove the two bow                 and two stern tie down straps from the toolbox.    14. Using the two bow and two stern ratchet tie downs, secure the boat to the trailer and tighten the tie downs.    15. Using the wrench, remove the bilge plug and transom plug from the hull. Allow all water to drain from the bilge.    16. Using a wrench and anti seizing tape, reinstall the bilge plug and transom plug in the hull.    17. Engage the engine lock lever and trim the engines to the trailering position.    18. Turn the house, port engine, and starboard engine battery switches to the OFF position. WARNING: Antennas and masts can conduct electricity. Ensure the antenna and masts are lowered prior to transporting a boat. Do not allow the antenna or masts to contact overhead power lines. Failure to comply may result in damage to equipment, injury, or death.     19. Lower and secure the VHF antenna, dive mast, and radome mast.    20.
