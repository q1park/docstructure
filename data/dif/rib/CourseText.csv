Keep the emergency stop lanyard free from obstructions and entanglements. Failure to comply may result in damage to equipment or injury.Boat stability and steering torque can vary due to changing water conditions. During adverse conditions, reduce throttle and/or trim to maintain control. Failure to comply may result in ejecting or otherwise seriously injuring occupants.The operator must always announce sudden changes in throttle or steering to crew. Failure to comply may result in injury.   Perform casting off or weighing anchor as necessary.While maintaining control of the helm, slowly engage the port and starboard throttles to a safe operating speed.Using the Multi-Functional Display, maintain the plotted course.Upon reaching speeds great enough to create a wake, turn the fuel tank vent blower to the OFF position.Upon reaching your destination, gradually throttle down the engines and bring the boat to a standstill.Perform anchoring or mooring procedures as necessary."
52592,"Trimming Engines Procedure The following steps will instruct you on how to properly trim the engines: CAUTION: Do not over trim the outboard engines while underway. Over trimming will cause the propellers to exit the water. A rapid increase in the outboard engines RPMs is evidence of cavitation or propellers coming out of the water. If this occurs, immediately reduce throttles and trim down the engines. Failure to comply will result in damage to equipment.The trim of the boat is the relationship between the angle of the outboard engines and the transom. Trim dictates the way the boat performs over the water and gains the greatest power and efficiency of the outboard engines as it relates to the boat. Different sea states will influence the trim levels to achieve the best planning and maneuverability of the boat. When trimming the engines underway, trim both engines using only the trim control switch (Item 1).When operating in shallow waters, trim the engines UP and slow the speed.When accelerating, first ensure the engines are timed fully DOWN. Then, adjust the trim of the engines UP to achieve the best handling for the boat.If the bow is too low, the outboard engines are trimmed too far DOWN. Trim the engines UP to correct this situation.If the bow is too high, the outboard engines are trimmed too far UP. Trim the engines DOWN to correct this situation."
52594,"Docking Procedure The following steps will instruct you on how to properly dock the RIB: CAUTION: In order to avoid collisions, maintain idle speeds while positioning the boat for docking. Failure to comply may result in damage to equipment. NOTE: Docking procedures as outlined may change due to different environmental factors. Adjustments to docking procedures will be dictated by dock arrangement, boat traffic, weather, and sea state. Place the throttle in the FORWARD IDLE position and approach the docking point at a 45? angle.Position the boat with the bow alongside the dock and place the throttle levers in the NEUTRAL position. NOTE: If mooring lines were removed during operation, they may need to be reattached to the forward and aft cleats.      3. Have an assistant pass the bow line to the dock, secure the line to a forward boat cleat, and then secure the line          to the dock.      4. Maneuver the stern of the boat towards the dock.     5. Have an assistant pass the stern line to the dock and secure line to aft boat cleat and the and secure the line to            the dock.     6. Turn the house battery to the OFF position.     7. Perform engine shutdown procedure."

52595,"Preparing to Anchor Procedure The following steps will instruct you on how to properly prepare to anchor a RIB: To begin, you must first understand the concept of Scope. Scope is the length of the anchor line relative to the distance from the boat cleat to the water bottom. As the scope increases, the horizontal pull on the anchor will also increase, burying the anchor deeper into the sea bottom. As the scope decreases, the horizontal pull will also decrease, causing the anchor to become vertical and possibly dislodged from the sea bottom. A 5-to-1 scope is recommended for proper anchoring. As an example, 5 ft. of anchor line would be required for every 1 ft of water depth. CAUTION: A scope of less than 5-to-1 will significantly decrease the anchor?s holding power. Failure to comply could result in damage to equipment.Ensure that the anchor chain is firmly fastened to the anchor line prior to dropping anchor. Failure to comply could result in loss of equipment. Have an assistant remove the anchor and anchor line from the bow compartment. WARNING: Never attach the anchor line to any rail, rail fitting, or other deck hardware. Failure to comply could result in damage to equipment or injury.      2. Attach the anchor line to the port or starboard mid-cleat.     3. Place the anchor and coil anchor line near bow to prevent knotting and fouling when dropping anchor.     4. Position the boat heading into the wind or current.     5. Approach the anchoring site at idle speed.     6. Turn the navigation lights switch to the ANCHOR position.     7. Once at the anchoring site, place the throttle levers in the NEUTRAL position."

52596,"Dropping Anchor Procedure The following steps will instruct you on how to properly drop anchor: CAUTION: Do not throw the anchor overboard, as the anchor line could become fouled. Failure to comply may result in damage to equipment. From port or starboard bow, lower the anchor slowly into the water.Maintain tension on the anchor line while lowering, and continue to maintain tension after the anchor reaches the bottom.Using the Multi-Function Display, mark the anchor point and set the anchor watch alarm. WARNING: Ensure that the crew is not between the anchor line and the side of the boat. Failure to comply may result in injury.      4. Place the throttle levers in the REVERSE position and slowly maneuver the boat backward until the                                  predetermined scope is payed out.     5. Place the throttle levers in the NEUTRAL position. NOTE: Ensure that the anchor line is being secured to the same side of the boat as the anchor line attachment.      6. Secure the anchor line around the port or starboard bow cleat.     7. Stow the anchor line slack in the forward open bow compartment.     8. Engage the throttle levers slowly until the anchor is firmly set on the bottom.     9. Shutdown the engines.    10. While anchored, monitor the plotter every 30 minutes to ensure that the boat is not drifting and the anchor is               not dragging.    11. If the boat is drifting outside of the swing circle on the plotter or the  anchor alarm sounds, the anchor is                      dragging and needs to be reset. Repeat steps 1-9."
52597,"Weighing Anchor Procedure The following steps will instruct you on how to properly weigh anchor: Start the outboard engines.Place the throttle levers in the FORWARD position and slowly maneuver the boat forward over anchor while pulling in the anchor line slack.Once the boat is directly over the anchor and the anchor line is vertical, place the throttle levers in the NEUTRAL position. Remove the anchor line from the bow cleat and pull in the slack.Re-secure the anchor line to the bow cleat. CAUTION: Do not power the boat forward. Heavy loads could be placed on the anchor and supporting hardware. Failure to comply could result in damage to equipment.      5. Slowly maneuver the boat backwards to unseat the anchor.     6. Pull the remaining anchor line and anchor from the water.       7. Remove the anchor line from the bow cleat.     8. Remove the anchor line from the mid-cleat.     9.
