	The boat is a rigid hull craft with 100 sq ft (9.2 sq m) of deck space with a center console design. It is capable of carrying 3,815 lbs (1730 kg) of payload with a full tank of fuel. The RIB is towed and fielded on its own Department Of Transportation (DOT) compliant trailer. The RIB provides dive units with the organic capability to conduct Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus (SCUBA) and surface supplied diving missions in areas previously unreachable due to limited range, speed, and payload of inflatable craft. This increases unit effectiveness by allowing faster response time to emergency missions and greater flexibility in location selection.	-1	90	2	1	0		4		0	The RIB is a rigid hull craft with 100 sq.ft (9,2 sqm) of deck space and carries 3,815 pounds (1730 kg) of payload - with 'full tank fuel	The RIB is a rigid hull craft with 100 sq.ft (9,2 sqm) of deck space and carries 3,815 pounds (1730 kg) of payload - with 'full tank fuel

	"Corrosion prevention and control of Army materiel is a continuing concern. It is important that any corrosion problems with this item be reported so that the problem can be corrected and improvements can be made to prevent the problem in future items. The term ""corrosion"" means the deterioration of a material or its properties due to a reaction of that materiel with its chemical environment. An example is the rusting of iron. Corrosion damage in metals can be seen, depending on the metal, as tarnishing, pitting, fogging, surface residue, and/or cracking. Plastics, composites, and rubbers can also degrade (also considered to be corrosion based on the above definition of corrosion). Degradation is caused by thermal (heat), oxidation (oxygen), solvation (solvents), or photolytic (light, typically ultraviolet) processes. The most common exposures are excessive heat or light. Damage from these processes will appear as cracking, softening, swelling, and/or breaking. The US Army has defined the following nine (9) forms of corrosion used to evaluate the deterioration of metals. These shall be used when evaluating and documenting corrosion."	-1	96	2	1	0		4		0	Aaron carroll: any corrosion problems should be reported to prevent future problems.

	The Rigid Inflatable Boat (RIB) is a rigid hull craft with a 100 sq ft (9.2 sq m) of deck space and a center console design. It is capable of carrying 3,815 lbs (1,730 kg) of payload with a full tank of fuel. Twin outboard engines are hard-mounted to the craft with sufficient power to meet payload and performance requirements. The RIB is towed and fielded on its own Department Of Transportation (DOT) compliant trailer with interchangeable pintle ring and ball type hitch with a surge type braking system to ensure interoperability between military and civilian vehicles. This trailer is compatible with the Light Medium Tactical Vehicle (LMTV) and/or Medium Tactical Vehicle (MTV) depending on mission specific payload requirements.	-1	133	2	2	0		5		0	The RIB is capable of carrying 3,815 pounds (1,730 kg) of payload with full tank fuel.

	Capsizing is when the boat leans to one side too far and is not able to right itself or regain proper position. During capsizing, the boat will roll 90° and settle on its beam or roll 180° and settle with its keel above water. The boat is inherently buoyant and is able to remain afloat after capsizing.	-1	817	3	30	0		37		0	Boat leans to one side too far and is not able right itself or regain proper position.

	"Corrosion prevention and control of Army materiel is a continuing concern. It is important that any corrosion problems with this item be reported so that the problem can be corrected and improvements can be made to prevent the problem in future items. The term ""corrosion"" means the deterioration of a material or its properties due to a reaction of that material with its chemical environment. An example is the rusting of iron. Corrosion damage in metals can be seen, depending on the metal, as tarnishing, pitting, fogging, surface residue, and/or cracking. Plastics, composites, and rubbers can also degrade (also considered to be corrosion based on the above definition of corrosion). Degradation is caused by thermal (heat), oxidation (oxygen), solvation (solvents), or photolytic (light, typically ultraviolet) processes. The most common exposures are excessive heat or light. Damage from these processes will appear as cracking, softening, swelling, and/or breaking. The US Army has defined the following nine (9) forms of corrosion used to evaluate the deterioration of metals. These shall be used when evaluating and documenting corrosion."	-1	1241	5	2	0		60		0	Aaron carroll: any corrosion problems should be reported to prevent future problems.
