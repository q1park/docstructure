The system is designed to be operated while mounted in the back of a M1083 vehicle or on a M1095 trailer, while stationary or mobile. The HMDS Power Unit uses a Diesel engine-powered air compressor to create and propel decontamination solutions through a 1.5\" (3.81cm) pump. It deploys these solutions through vehicle- or trailer-mounted spray bars, a remote-control stanchion-mounted Monitor (water cannon), and non-collapsible hoses with D-Bale handset(s). The HMDS is capable of drafting from external water sources, such as bulk **tanks** or natural bodies of water. In addition to the Power Unit, the HMDS incorporates two solution-mixing **tanks**, each with a fill capacity of 750 gallons.

Alternatively, it can be fed by the Red Banded Discharge Hoses, or any other 1.5\" diameter hose in the HMDS hose kit. The Hopper/Blender is located next to the Agitator and has two (2) 1/2\" stainless steel bars in the funnel section. These bars support the removable screen and help prevent objects from accidentally falling into the **tank**. If there are ?clumps? of decontaminant on the bars or screen, use a disposable dipstick made of wood or plastic (supplied by the unit) to **break** them down to a size which will allow the clumps to feed through the screen. WARNING! DO NOT use a hammer, metal objects, or excessive force that could cause damage to the Hopper. If ?clumps? are not easily **break**able, simply remove them from the Hopper. WARNING! Avoid sticking fingers or gloved hands into the screen holes, as this may result in serious cuts.',\n",

The spray bars themselves are designed with four (4) ?\", 80-degree fan spray tips. Each tip produces ~60 psi of pressure. The FSB also has attachable ?wings? or outriggers to extend the spraying pattern wider (up to 32\\' wide) using a total of 8 fan spray tips/nozzles. The Rear Spray Bar (RSB) is also a universal fit.

The slide is designed to keep the spray bar from rolling down and must be butted against the trailer by the locked down slide to keep it from doing so. The slide will be retracted and tightened down for placement on the rear of the truck. The slide will be extended and locked down for placement on the trailer. Ensure the slide bolt is tight. Check periodically and re-tighten if rolling starts to occur. Non-armored vehicles may require the installer to disassemble and invert the truck side of the adjustable slide bracket. The Front Spray Bar (FSB) is equipped with two capped ends that enable the attachment of extensions, sometimes called ?outriggers? or ?wings?, to provide a significantly wider spray pattern. The wings are marked with red markings and an \"R\" on the right side, and green markings and an \"L\" on the left side. The orientation of the nozzles on the wings are important for correct function of the spray bars; the slots should be in line with the long axis of the bars. Attach the wings using the Instalock camlock fittings and ensure there is a rubber gasket in each of them for correct sealing and seating. Each wing will swivel rearward if it strikes a fixed item while the vehicle is moving. The gasket may need to be replaced often due to wear on the part.',\n",

CAUTION: The Agitator and the Hopper/Blender hoses will contain slurry. Rinse and clean out these hoses and any fittings thoroughly before storing them in the **tank** basket. CAUTION: After the slurry is blended, it must be agitated constantly until used. It is useful to agitate with both the Agitator and the Hopper/Blender. Use the ?Agitator? function on Selector Valve #1 and ?Monitor? on Selector Valve #2. Then, route the Monitor hose (Purple Band) or a short discharge hose (Double Red Band) to the Hopper/Blender. The alternate is to use the #2 Discharge port to the Hopper/Blender with a Double Red Banded hose. Decide which method you will use in advance, as to avoid changing over hoses and connections. After blending is complete, replace the **tank** lid. Agitate the slurry mixture and avoid adding air with the Agitator to reduce foaming.',\n",

The larger diameter (1.5\") hoses have EZLink camlock connectors for fast and easy, one-handed installation and de-installation. The smaller diameter (1\") hoses use Instalock camlock connectors. The suction and drafting hoses are made of blue-colored, reinforced PVC to retain rigidity under suction.

They are 15\\' long, have a 1\" diameter, are made of the Red Booster Hose material, and are marked with an Orange Band. Typically, one of these hoses is routed over the tailgate of the truck and can be held in place with magnets that are stored in the Accessory Box of the De-Icer Kit. In order to reach the rear of the trailer, both Orange Banded hoses can be connected with the 1\" male-male adapter. This hose can also be attached to the Agitator on the trailer **tank**. The Instalock connectors on these hoses require two hands to attach and detach.',\n",

Two Tanks (Truck and Trailer) The Two-Tank configuration uses both of the 750-Gallon **tanks** for the slurry mixing operation. The main (truck) **tank** is used to mix the slurry and the trailer **tank** is a source of water for mixing and rinsing the truck **tank**. The availability of rinse water is necessary to help clear any clogged lines and to rapidly flush out the system after discharging the slurry. Using the Tank Selector Valve attached to the rear of the Power Unit, attach the Suction Main (Single Black Band) hose to the left side of the Tank Selector Valve and the Trailer Suction hose (Double Black Band) to the right side. Then, connect each hose to the appropriate **tank** and open up the Tank Drain Valves. Connect the White Banded Hopper/Blender hose to the Hopper/Blender on the truck **tank** and connect the other end to the Monitor port on the back of the Power Unit. Next, connect the Single Yellow Banded Agitator hose to the Agitator port on the truck **tank** and connect the other end to the Agitator Port on the back side of the Power Unit. To fill the main truck **tank** with water, turn the Tank Selector Valve to ?Trailer?. Once the fluid level is sufficient for your Mission/slurry batch size (verified with the **tank** level Indicator) turn the Tank Selector Valve to draw from the main truck **tank**.',\n",
