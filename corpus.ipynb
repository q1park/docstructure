The screen has a handle on top and several 1\" diameter holes across its surface. The holes assist with **breaking** up clumps of powdered or granular decontaminant that could clog the 1.5\" diameter funnel output spout. The Hopper/Blender is primarily fed by a 1.5\" EZLink camlock fitting on the White Banded Hopper Hose. Alternatively, it can be fed by the Red Banded Discharge Hoses, or any other 1.5\" diameter hose in the HMDS hose kit. The Hopper/Blender is located next to the Agitator and has two (2) 1/2\" stainless steel bars in the funnel section. These bars support the removable screen and help prevent objects from accidentally falling into the **tank**. If there are ?clumps? of decontaminant on the bars or screen, use a disposable dipstick made of wood or plastic (supplied by the unit) to **break** them down to a size which will allow the clumps to feed through the screen. WARNING! DO NOT use a hammer, metal objects, or excessive force that could cause damage to the Hopper. If ?clumps? are not easily **break**able, simply remove them from the Hopper. WARNING! Avoid sticking fingers or gloved hands into the screen holes, as this may result in serious cuts.',\n",

       "  'The 8\\' long Spray Bars are designed to be universally fit-enabled by an adjustable slide bracket mechanism. This allows for up to 2? of lateral adjustability during installation. This mechanism also allows for interchangeability between the Front Spray Bar (FSB) mounts on the M1083 variants. The spray bars are held in place with the clevis pins on the shackle mounts. The spray bars themselves are designed with four (4) ?\", 80-degree fan spray tips. Each tip produces ~60 psi of pressure. The FSB also has attachable ?wings? or outriggers to extend the spraying pattern wider (up to 32\\' wide) using a total of 8 fan spray tips/nozzles. The Rear Spray Bar (RSB) is also a universal fit. It can be mounted on the rear of the M1083 FMTV style trucks and the M1095 series trailers. WARNING! NEVER stand on the spray bars. Doing so may cause injury and/or system damage.'],\n",

The second, pictured below the first, with the LONG extension will be mounted on the REAR of either the truck or trailer. The slide is designed to keep the spray bar from rolling down and must be butted against the trailer by the locked down slide to keep it from doing so. The slide will be retracted and tightened down for placement on the rear of the truck. The slide will be extended and locked down for placement on the trailer. Ensure the slide bolt is tight. Check periodically and re-tighten if rolling starts to occur. Non-armored vehicles may require the installer to disassemble and invert the truck side of the adjustable slide bracket. The Front Spray Bar (FSB) is equipped with two capped ends that enable the attachment of extensions, sometimes called ?outriggers? or ?wings?, to provide a significantly wider spray pattern. The wings are marked with red markings and an \"R\" on the right side, and green markings and an \"L\" on the left side. The orientation of the nozzles on the wings are important for correct function of the spray bars; the slots should be in line with the long axis of the bars. Attach the wings using the Instalock camlock fittings and ensure there is a rubber gasket in each of them for correct sealing and seating. Each wing will swivel rearward if it strikes a fixed item while the vehicle is moving. The gasket may need to be replaced often due to wear on the part.',\n",

This also signals that the Power Unit started to run outside one or several of the programmed operating ranges. If the following unit-level troubleshooting methods do not resolve the issue, STOP and always contact maintenance support. Continued use of the Power Unit could cause severe damage to the system's components. The Programmable Logic Control (PLC) navigation button allows for scrolling to obtain specific engine operational data which monitors the safety cut-off features. These parameters must be set and adjusted only by qualified service technicians. WARNING!The following Trouble Shooting-Corrective Actions are considered Maintainer level tasks.

Check the fuel line connections on the back of the Power Unit. If contaminated fuel is suspected, change the fuel supply and empty the water/fuel separator. Shut the system down and allow the system to cool. DO NOT check oil levels until the oil has had time to drain back into the pan. Verify the oil drain valve is in the closed position.

The screen has a handle on top and several 1\" diameter holes across its surface. The holes assist with **breaking** up clumps of powdered or granular decontaminant that could clog the 1.5\" diameter funnel output spout. The Hopper/Blender is primarily fed by a 1.5\" EZLink camlock fitting on the White Banded Hopper Hose.

The Hopper/Blender is located next to the Agitator and has two (2) 1/2\" stainless steel bars in the funnel section. These bars support the removable screen and help prevent objects from accidentally falling into the **tank**. If there are ?clumps? of decontaminant on the bars or screen, use a disposable dipstick made of wood or plastic (supplied by the unit) to **break** them down to a size which will allow the clumps to feed through the screen. WARNING! DO NOT use a hammer, metal objects, or excessive force that could cause damage to the Hopper. If ?clumps? are not easily **break**able, simply remove them from the Hopper. WARNING!
