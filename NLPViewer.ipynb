In such contexts, it follows the anglicized pronunciation and usually omits any mark between its two As. In close transliteration of the Semitic name, the ayin is represented, as Baʿal. In the Northwest Semitic languages—Ugaritic, Phoenician, Hebrew, Amorite, and Aramaic—the word baʿal signified \"owner\" and, by extension, \"lord\", a \"master\", or \"husband\". Cognates include the Akkadian Bēlu (𒂗), Amharic bal (ባል), and Arabic baʿl (بَعْل). Báʿal (בַּעַל) and baʿl still serve as the words for \"husband\" in modern Hebrew and Arabic respectively. They also appear in some contexts concerning the ownership of things or possession of traits. The feminine form is baʿalah (Hebrew: בַּעֲלָה\\u200e; Arabic: بَعْلَة\\u200e), meaning \"mistress\" in the sense of a female owner or lady of the house and still serving as a rare word for \"wife\". Suggestions in early modern scholarship also included comparison with the Celtic god Belenus.',\n",
       " 'Like EN in Sumerian, the Akkadian bēlu and Northwest Semitic baʿal (as well as its feminine form baʿalah) was used as a title of various deities in the Mesopotamian and Semitic pantheons. Only a definitive article, genitive or epithet, or context could establish which particular god was meant.',\n",
       " 'Baʿal was also used as a proper name by the third millennium BCE, when he appears in a list of deities at Abu Salabikh. Most modern scholarship asserts that this Baʿal—usually distinguished as \"The Lord\" (הבעל, Ha Baʿal)—was identical with the storm and fertility god Hadad; it also appears in the form Baʿal Haddu. Scholars propose that, as the cult of Hadad increased in importance, his true name came to be seen as too holy for any but the high priest to speak aloud and the alias \"Lord\" (\"Baʿal\") was used instead, as \"Bel\" was used for Marduk among the Babylonians and \"Adonai\" for Yahweh among the Israelites. A minority propose that Baʿal was a native Canaanite deity whose cult was identified with or absorbed aspects of Adad\\'s. Regardless of their original relationship, by the 1st millennium BCE, the two were distinct: Hadad was worshipped by the Aramaeans and Baʿal by the Phoenicians and other Canaanites.']"
